# Data Analysis on U.S Flight Record Dataset (R)
### Below is the code I used for this project along with a description.
- This an Academic project that I carried out in part of the data analysis course I was taking at UTD, STAT 3355- Data Analysis
- The Problems.pdf contains the problems that I answered, and the Solutions.pdf contains all the solutions
- I Analyzed data and found best fitting distributions in order to obtain expected values and probabilities, and inlcuded such plots showcasing the pearson residuals
- I Derived and presented meaningful conclusions from a real dataset of 260,000 objects and 9 variables
